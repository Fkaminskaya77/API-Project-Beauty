# Sephora Beauty Products 

## Intoduction


This project is about creating a Rest API using datasets in JSON fromat.Implenting the CRUD method and using express and mongoose to make a useful working API

## What is my API about?

I created this project with my love for Sephora and Beauty Products. This API is about the brands that are carried by Sephora and specifically the categories of moisturizers, treatments, and wellness products. Besides the brand names you recieve extra details about the products like price, ratings from customers and if the product is clean/vegan. I wanted to be able to make an API, for anyone else who loves beauty products and to be able to share more data to everyone about beauty information.
